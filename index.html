    <h3>Business Technology Management</h3>
    <p>The BTM Program at TMU combines a love for technology, business and management, allowing me to gain a strong 
        understanding of business principles and drive ICT-based innovation with theoretical and practical learning. 
        I've learned to analyze business needs, design appropriate technology-based processes and solutions and communicate 
        these effectively.

    <h3>Relevant Courses</h3>

        <li><strong>ITM618:</strong> This course was about Business Intelligence and Analytics. 
            It provided a great opportunity to learn about descriptive and prescriptive analysis in python. 
            I learned to create predictive models and conducted data analysis on large datasets. 
            It was a great first step to growing my skills and progress towards a career in analytics.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>ITM500:</strong> This course helped me learn about Data Management and Database Designs. It was also 
        a great chance to grow my skills in SQL. I learned how a database is structured and how queries can be performed
        to extract relevant data from those large databases.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>ITM707:</strong> Another fantastic course that saw the class studying and solving business cases
        from around the globe. It gave insights to real world problems that occur in large corporations, so the chance 
        to get an inside look on those issues and best ways to approach the resolution was key in developing my 
        problem-solving and analytical skills.</li>
